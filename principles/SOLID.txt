S.O.L.I.D stands for:
When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.

S - Single-responsiblity principle
O - Open-closed principle
L - Liskov substitution principle
I - Interface segregation principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle


Single-responsibility Principle
S.R.P for short - this principle states that:

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.


Open-closed Principle
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


Liskov substitution principle
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.


Interface segregation principle
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.


Dependency Inversion principle
The last, but definitely not the least states that:

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
